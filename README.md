## Overview

This was a group project assigned during Mod 3 at Turing.  We were tasked with creating a movie rating web application.  Users can view information about a variety of movies, including their average rating among all users.  Additionally, a user can log in and add or change their own ratings of movies.

The goal of this project was to demonstrate our skill with the following:
 - React fundamentals
 - React Router
 - Testing components and asynchronous JavaScript
 - Navigating a shared, persistent API
 - Redux state management and testing
